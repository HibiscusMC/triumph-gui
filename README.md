This is a fork of [TriumphTeam/triumph-gui](https://github.com/TriumphTeam/triumph-gui) with first-class Paper support.
Specifically, it was made to avoid issues that can occur when serializing adventure components to legacy-formatted
strings when dealing with GUI titles.

It also generally tidies up parts of the project, such as updating dependencies, cleaning up Javadoc comments, and
removing deprecated cruft.
